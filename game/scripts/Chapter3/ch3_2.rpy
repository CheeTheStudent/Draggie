    Suddenly, you stopped. 

    Darrick: "What’s the matter?"

    mc "I think we’ve got company..." saying while firing a blast towards nearby grass.

    dr "Hey, leave some for me. Fighting demons is the only way to ______(clear, solve, stop) my boredom." 

    They were preparing to fight.

    Demons run away…

    dr "...Ahh, that’s it? Hey, demons! Come back!" ran to chase the demons, but he stopped.

    mc "Darrick?"

    dr "Woah, Mc, there’s a boy here, still breathing!"

    mc "Is he hurt or something?"

    dr "Nope. He looks fine but just unconscious."

    mc "Okay, we rest here today and find out who he is tomorrow."

    -----------------------------------------The next day -------------------------------------------

    b: "Argh..."

    dr "Oh, you’re _____ (awake, awaken, awoke)! Do you want some bread?"

    Player answered correctly
    b: "...yes, please."
    The boy gets the bread and stares at both of you.

    Player answered wrong
    b: "..."
    The boy doesn’t answer and stares at both of you.

    dr ".... MC, am I looking weird?"

    mc "Huh? No. Why did you ask?"

    dr "He’s staring at me, don’t you see?"

    mc "Not just you. He’s staring at me too."

    dr "Oh ya? ...oh, oh, okay."

    dr "...Are we done staring at each other?"

    b "Who are you?"

    mc "Don’t you think it’s better to tell yours before asking for others?"

    dr "Yes, that’s right, I agree."

    b "..."

    After some time, the boy started introducing himself. 

    b "I only remember that my name is Edgar. I don’t remember anything else."

    dr "I am Darrick, and he is MC. So, why are you here unconsciously?"

    mc "He already said he doesn't remember anything."

    dr "Ya, I heard that."

    mc "Then, why are you asking again?"

    dr "I… just… Okay, fine."

    ed smiles.

    ed "Well, what are you doing out here?"

    dr "We are heading to Elysium. Do you want to follow us?"

    ed "..."

    You "It’s dangerous out here alone. We can protect you until your memory recovers."

    ed nods quietly.

    So you and your friends continue your journey and reach the mansion of Dragons in Elysium.

    mc "Wow, this is something beyond my _________(expectations, imaginations, apprehension)"

    dr "Yeah, it’s insane! I’m claiming this house. Let’s just live here from now on!" (grin)

    ed "...MC, I think we can leave him here."

    dr "Hey! You made a joke! You’re one of us now!"

    mc "Welcome to the gang."

    Darrick runs into the mansion (while, although, but) you and Edgar follow behind closely.

    (Prank Darrick, Ask Darrick to slow down)

    Branch 1:
    mc "Watch out, someone is behind you!"

    dr "Oh my god, where!!??"

    ed "Above you!"

    Darrick looks up and trips on the uneven ground.

    dr "Ouch! That hurts!"

    You and Edgar laugh, watching Darrick pout on the ground. (Edgar smile)

    Darrick gets up and storms away, pretending to be mad.

    Branch 2:
    mc "Watch out!"

    Darrick stops in his tracks and looks down at the uneven ground.

    dr "Phew, thanks for the heads up!"

    mc "You are welcome."

    End branches
    ed "Let’s move on, shall we?"

    You and your friends continue exploring the mansion further and eventually find a _______(flight, flock, fleet) of stairs leading to an underground basement.

    dr "It’s so scary down here… Hold me."

    You and Edgar ignore Darrick and continue walking down the stairs.

    dr "Hey! Wait for me!"

    In front of you, you notice a bright, red light coming from the end of the stairs.

    mc "Guys, something is in front."

    You and your friends walk closer to the red light and notice that it is being ______ (amitted, emitted, admitted) from a floating crystal-like object.

    dr "Woah, what do you think that is?"

    mc "I have no idea. Let’s take a closer look."

    You approach the crystal, your vision blurring due to the bright reflection it emits.

    You reach your hand out and look towards Darrick for reassurance.

    mc "Should I?

    Darrick nods his head in agreement, and without a second thought, you wrap your fingers around the crystal.
