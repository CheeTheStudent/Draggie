## 🐉 About this Game
<p> Descendant of the Dragons is a visual novel learning game that tests players on their grammatical and vocabulary skills while taking them on an adventure
in a fantasy world where dragons and demons roam the Earth alongside humans. The game follows the same mechanics as a standard visual novel game but instead 
of only choosing between choices the character makes, players are prompted with English questions to answer as well. The fate of the characters are determined
by how well players answer all the questions. </p>

## 🎯 Objectives
1. To create a game-based learning activity for the English subject.
2. To focus on teaching primary school students between the ages of 6-12.
